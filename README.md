Alexa Gadget to display countdown timers

This is based on the AlexaGadget timer example at https://github.com/alexa-samples/Alexa-Gadgets-Raspberry-Pi-Samples. 

This handles multiple timers at once, displaying the one with the shortest time. New timers can be added. Timers can be changed. Timers can be deleted.

Displays the time left on a four-letter phat. Code runs on a Raspberry Pi Zero W.
